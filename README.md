## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PAVANNAIK25/pokedex.git

### 2. Install Dependencies

We are using `pnpm` for package management. If you haven't installed `pnpm` yet, you can install it globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Once you have `pnpm` installed, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will launch the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
